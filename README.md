# spotify-clone-html-css
A simple Spotify UI clone built using only HTML and CSS. This project replicates the design and layout of the Spotify web player with responsive styling. Currently, itâ€™s a static clone with no backend functionality, but future updates may include JavaScript features like play/pause, progress bar, and volume control.
